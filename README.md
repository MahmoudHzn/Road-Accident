# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built in **Power BI**, providing a visual representation of road accident data. It enables users to gain insights into accident trends, contributing factors, and geographic distributions to support data-driven decisions for improving road safety.

## Features
- **Key Metrics and KPIs**: Total accidents, fatalities, injuries, and other key indicators are presented as cards and visualizations.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Interactive maps highlight accident locations, density, and regional distributions.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Visualizations track accident trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly) to identify seasonal patterns.
- **Contributing Factors**: Charts analyze factors like weather, road conditions, vehicle types, and driver behavior contributing to accidents.
- **Comparative Insights**: Compare accident data by dimensions such as road type, urban vs rural areas, and vehicle categories.
- **Drill-down and Filtering**: Dive deeper into data points and filter by specific conditions, regions, or timeframes.
- **Interactive Reports**: Multiple report pages offer a holistic and flexible analysis of the data.

## Data Source
The data used in this dashboard is sourced from a structured dataset containing road accident records, including:
- Accident severity
- Weather and road conditions
- Vehicle types
- Geographic locations and timeframes

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Modeling**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis within Power BI.

## Insights Delivered
1. Identification of high-risk areas and accident hotspots using maps and geographic visuals.
2. Analysis of accident severity and contributing factors, enabling targeted safety measures.
3. Year-on-year trends to monitor the effectiveness of safety interventions.
4. Comparative analysis of urban vs rural accident statistics.

## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file from the repository.
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop.
3. Interact with the visuals, apply filters, and explore detailed insights.
